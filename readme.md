# cst.dev - Personal Developer Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for **cst.dev**, a personal developer portfolio designed to showcase my projects, act as a host for live versions of those projects, and provide links to their repositories. This project is inspired by the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) interface, combining functionality with a unique and visually engaging design.

## Project Overview

**cst.dev** is built with a React frontend and utilizes Tailwind CSS alongside Material-Tailwind for styling. The project emulates the user interface of Visual Studio Code, including elements such as file explorers, tabs, and custom theming. The design choice was motivated by the challenge of recreating a familiar coding environment in a web format, making it an interesting experiment in both usability and aesthetic appeal.
